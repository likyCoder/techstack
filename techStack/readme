## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.x
- MySQL/MariaDB
- Apache/Nginx (XAMPP recommended for local development)
- Composer (optional, for future package management)

### Installation

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eduportal.git
   ```

2. **Import the Database**
   - Open `phpMyAdmin` or use the MySQL CLI.
   - Import the SQL file:
     ```
     source includes/database.sql
     ```
   - This will create the `eduportal` database and all required tables with sample data.

3. **Configure Database Connection**
   - Edit `includes/db_connect.php` and/or `includes/db.php` if your MySQL credentials differ from the default (`root`/no password).

4. **Set Up Web Server**
   - Place the project folder in your web server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
   - Access the app at `http://localhost/techStack/index.php`.

5. **Register or Login**
   - Use the registration page to create a new student account, or log in with the sample admin/teacher/student accounts provided in the SQL.

## Default Accounts (Sample Data)

| Role    | Username   | Email                  | Password   |
|---------|------------|------------------------|------------|
| Admin   | admin      | admin@eduportal.com    | password   |
| Teacher | teacher1   | teacher1@eduportal.com | password   |
| Student | student1   | student1@eduportal.com | password   |

> **Note:** All sample passwords are `password` (hashed in the database).

---

## Customization

- **Add More Classes/Subjects:** Use the admin or teacher account to create new classes and subjects.
- **Change Branding:** Edit `assets/style.css` and `includes/header.php` for colors, logos, and layout.
- **Add More Features:** Extend with more modules (e.g., forums, messaging) as needed.

## Security Notes

- All user input is validated and sanitized.
- Passwords are hashed using PHP's `password_hash`.
- CSRF protection is implemented on all forms.
- Sessions are used for authentication and role management.
